# How rasa learns:
# Tokenizes the sentence
# Extracts features (e.g., word embeddings, position)
# Runs it through a trained classifier (like DIETClassifier)
# Assigns the most probable intent: express_mood

# behind the scene:
# Uses deep learning (e.g., Transformer layers) in models like DIETClassifier
# Trained on the examples you provide in nlu.yml
# Supports fuzzy matches, synonyms, and even multilingual inputs (with some setup)
